HDR Metropolis City Skies

These amazing HDR skies in the category City are designed to make your scene and its contents look impressive and brilliant in an urban environment!

IMPORTANT: The .hdr files are of very high quality and of big filesize when importing. Therefore, the import process can take up to several minutes. Please don't end Unity when the progress bar stays at 83%. This is normal and just needs some more time, so please be patient! You will be able to compress the texture to the preferred file size and quality for your project, once it has been imported.

Since Unity 5 you are able to natively use HDR (32 bit floating point) images as cubemaps for skyboxes. Only the use of these HDR images allows you to take full advantage of the Physically Based Shaders, Real-Time Global Illumination and HDR Reflection Probes. Normal .jpg, .png, and .tif Skyboxes will not give you the same results. You need to use a HDR image like these.

The images are very high quality equirectangular .hdr files specifically calibrated for Unity and attached to cubemap skybox materials - ready to use in your Unity project!
